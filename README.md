# Olist-SQL-Project-
The Olist dataset features ~100,000 orders from 3000 online sellers.  Orders have payment values and payment type.  It includes reviews with both numerical values and text (Portuguese). I used SQL to examine the relationship between reviews, orders and order delivery performance.
