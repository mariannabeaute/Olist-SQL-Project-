# Olist-SQL-Project-
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. The Olist dataset features ~100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018, and from 3000 online sellers in Brazil. Its' tables and columsn include order status, customer delivery date, price, product category, payment, customer location, and reviews written by customers. 

I used SQL to explore the data and examine the relationship between reviews, orders and order delivery performance. 

The dataset is available at Kaggle at this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce
